The reasoning is that a\n\t *   platform scroll view that isn't built on top of the responder system has\n\t *   began scrolling, and the active responder must now be notified that the\n\t *   interaction is no longer locked to it - the system has taken over.\n\t *\n\t * - Responder being released:\n\t *   As soon as no more touches that *started* inside of descendants of the\n\t *   *current* responderInst, an `onResponderRelease` event is dispatched to the\n\t *   current responder, and the responder lock is released.\n\t *\n\t * TODO:\n\t * - on \"end\", a callback hook for `onResponderEndShouldRemainResponder` that\n\t *   determines if the responder lock should remain.\n\t * - If a view shouldn't \"remain\" the responder, any active touches should by\n\t *   default be considered \"dead\" and do not influence future negotiations or\n\t *   bubble paths. It should be as if those touches do not exist.\n\t * -- For multitouch: Usually a translate-z will choose to \"remain\" responder\n\t *  after one out of many touches ended. For translate-y, usually the view\n\t *  doesn't wish to \"remain\" responder after one of many touches end.\n\t * - Consider building this on top of a `stopPropagation` model similar to\n\t *   `W3C`

about event ordering in the `EventPluginHub`.\n\t *\n\t * Suppose plugins are injected in the following order:\n\t *\n\t * `[R, S, C]`\n\t *\n\t * To help illustrate the example, assume `S` is `SimpleEventPlugin` (for\n\t * `onClick` etc) and `R` is `ResponderEventPlugin`.\n\t *\n\t * \"Deferred-Dispatched Events\":\n\t *\n\t * - The current event plugin system will traverse the list of injected plugins,\n\t *   in order, and extract events by collecting the plugin's return value of\n\t *   `extractEvents()`.\n\t * - These events that are returned from `extractEvents` are \"deferred\n\t *   dispatched events\".\n\t * - When returned from `extractEvents`, deferred-dispatched events contain an\n\t *   \"accumulation\" of deferred dispatches.\n\t * - These deferred dispatches are accumulated/collected before they are\n\t *   returned, but processed at a later time by the `EventPluginHub` (hence the\n\t *   name deferred).\n\t *\n\t * In the process of returning their deferred-dispatched events, event plugins\n\t * themselves can dispatch events on-demand without returning them from\n\t * `extractEvents`. Plugins might want to do this, so that they can use event\n\t * dispatching as a tool that helps them decide which events should be extracted\n\t * in the first place.\n\t *\n\t * \"On-Demand-Dispatched Events\":\n\t *\n\t * - On-demand-dispatched events are not returned from `extractEvents`.\n\t * - On-demand-dispatched events are dispatched during the process of returning\n\t *   the deferred-dispatched events.\n\t * - They should not have side effects.\n\t * - They should be avoided, and/or eventually be replaced with another\n\t *   abstraction that allows event plugins to perform multiple \"rounds\" of event\n\t *   extraction.\n\t *\n\t * Therefore, the sequence of event dispatches becomes:\n\t *\n\t * - `R`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `R` on-demand)\n\t * - `S`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `S` on-demand)\n\t * - `C`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `C` on-demand)\n\t * - `R`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n\t * - `S`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n\t * - `C`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n\t *\n\t * In the case of `ResponderEventPlugin`: If the `startShouldSetResponder`\n\t * on-demand dispatch returns `true` (and some other details are satisfied) the\n\t * `onResponderGrant` deferred dispatched event is returned from\n\t * `extractEvents`. The sequence of dispatch executions in this case\n\t * will appear as follows:\n\t *\n\t * - `startShouldSetResponder` (`ResponderEventPlugin` dispatches on-demand)\n\t * - `touchStartCapture`       (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n\t * - `touchStart`              (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n\t * - `responderGrant/Reject`   (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n\t */\n\t\n\tfunction setResponderAndExtractTransfer(topLevelType, targetInst, nativeEvent, nativeEventTarget) {\n\t  var shouldSetEventType = isStartish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.startShouldSetResponder : isMoveish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.moveShouldSetResponder : topLevelType === 'topSelectionChange' ? eventTypes.selectionChangeShouldSetResponder : eventTypes.scrollShouldSetResponder;\n\t\n\t  // TODO: stop one short of the current responder.\n\t  var bubbleShouldSetFrom = !responderInst ? targetInst : EventPluginUtils.getLowestCommonAncestor(responderInst, targetInst);\n\t\n\t  // When capturing/bubbling the \"shouldSet\" event, we want to skip the target\n\t  // (deepest ID) if it happens to be the current responder.

I have disconnected the database and registration form for now as that complicates the hosting scenario.\n         </p><p>\n           <img src={reactcode} className=\"react-code-img\" alt=\"react code\" />\n            <WorldMap />\n           </p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\nclass WorldMap extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"WorldMap\">\n        <div id=\"mapcontainer\">\n\t\t\t<ExpoHall className='expoA' title=\"Expo A\" expolocation=\"Paldere\" eventdates=\"5/2/2017\" top=\"200px\" left=\"150px\" style={{position:'absolute',top:'300px',left:'100px'}}/>\n\t\t\t<ExpoHall className='expoB' title=\"Expo B\" expolocation=\"Renvitts\" eventdates=\"6/22/2017\" top=\"400px\" left=\"150px\"  style={{top:'140px',left:'600px'}} />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n    \n}\n\nclass ExpoHall extends Component {\n\t\t\n\tconstructor(props) {\n\t\t  super(props);\n\t\t  this.setstate = {\n\t\t   isToggleOn:false,\n\t\t   style:{\n\t\t\t\t  top: '260px',\n\t\t\t\t  left: '260px'\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t  };\n\t  \n\t}  \n\n\thandleclick = function(expotitle,expolocation,expodates) {\n    \t\n\t\t\n\t\tReactDOM.render(\n\t\t  <ExpoDetails  title={expotitle} expoloc={expolocation} expodt={expodates} />,\n\t\t document.getElementById('expodetails')\n\t\t);\n\t\t\n  }\n  \n  componentDidMount(){\n\t  this.setstate = {\n\t\t   isToggleOn:false,\n\t\t   style:{\n\t\t\t\t  top: '260px',\n\t\t\t\t  left: '260px'\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t  };\n  }\n\n\t\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"ExpoHall\" ref=\"child\" onClick={this.handleclick.bind(this, this.props.title,this.props.expolocation,this.props.eventdates)}  >\n       <p> {this.props.title}</p>\n       \n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nclass ExpoDetails extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {isToggleOn: true};\n\n\t}\n\t\n\thandleclick = function(){\n\t\t//alert(\"load the expo hall map\");\n\t\tReactDOM.render(\n\t\t  <ExpoHallMap  title={this.props.title} expoloc={this.props.expoloc} expodt={this.props.expodt} />,\n\t\t document.getElementById('root')\n\t\t);\n\t\t\n\t\tReactDOM.render(\n\t\t  <br />,\n\t\t document.getElementById('expodetails')\n\t\t);\n\t}\n\t\n\trender() {\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t  <div className=\"ExpoDetails\" >\n\t\t   <p><b>Details for {this.props.title}</b></p>\n\t\t   <p>Expo location: <b>{this.props.expoloc}</b></p>\n\t\t    <p>Event Dates: <b>{this.props.expodt}</b></p> \n\t\t   <button onClick={this.handleclick.bind(this)}>Book your place</button>\n\t\t  </div>\n\t\t);\n  }\n\t\n }\n \n \n \n class ExpoHallMap extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"ExpoHallMap\">\n      <h3>{this.props.title} - {this.props.expoloc} - {this.props.expodt}</h3>\n        <div id=\"mapcontainer\">\n\t\t\t<Stand title=\"Stand1\" eventdates={this.props.expodt} booked={false} style={{top:'300px',left:'100px'}}/>\n\t\t\t<Stand title=\"Stand2\" eventdates={this.props.expodt} booked={false} style={{top:'140px',left:'600px'}} />\n\t\t\t<Stand title=\"Stand3\" eventdates={this.props.expodt} booked={false} style={{top:'240px',left:'300px'}} />\n\t\t\t\n        </div>\n   \n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n \n \nclass Stand extends Component {\n\t\n\tconstructor(props) {\n\t  super(props);\n\t   this.state = {booked: this.props.booked?

order:\n *\n * `[R, S, C]`\n *\n * To help illustrate the example, assume `S` is `SimpleEventPlugin` (for\n * `onClick` etc) and `R` is `ResponderEventPlugin`.\n *\n * \"Deferred-Dispatched Events\":\n *\n * - The current event plugin system will traverse the list of injected plugins,\n *   in order, and extract events by collecting the plugin's return value of\n *   `extractEvents()`.\n * - These events that are returned from `extractEvents` are \"deferred\n *   dispatched events\".\n * - When returned from `extractEvents`, deferred-dispatched events contain an\n *   \"accumulation\" of deferred dispatches.\n * - These deferred dispatches are accumulated/collected before they are\n *   returned, but processed at a later time by the `EventPluginHub` (hence the\n *   name deferred).\n *\n * In the process of returning their deferred-dispatched events, event plugins\n * themselves can dispatch events on-demand without returning them from\n * `extractEvents`. Plugins might want to do this, so that they can use event\n * dispatching as a tool that helps them decide which events should be extracted\n * in the first place.\n *\n * \"On-Demand-Dispatched Events\":\n *\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are not returned from `extractEvents`.\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are dispatched during the process of returning\n *   the deferred-dispatched events.\n * - They should not have side effects.\n * - They should be avoided, and/or eventually be replaced with another\n *   abstraction that allows event plugins to perform multiple \"rounds\" of event\n *   extraction.\n *\n * Therefore, the sequence of event dispatches becomes:\n *\n * - `R`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `R` on-demand)\n * - `S`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `S` on-demand)\n * - `C`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `C` on-demand)\n * - `R`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n * - `S`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n * - `C`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n *\n * In the case of `ResponderEventPlugin`: If the `startShouldSetResponder`\n * on-demand dispatch returns `true` (and some other details are satisfied) the\n * `onResponderGrant` deferred dispatched event is returned from\n * `extractEvents`. The sequence of dispatch executions in this case\n * will appear as follows:\n *\n * - `startShouldSetResponder` (`ResponderEventPlugin` dispatches on-demand)\n * - `touchStartCapture`       (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `touchStart`              (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `responderGrant/Reject`   (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n */\n\nfunction setResponderAndExtractTransfer(topLevelType, targetInst, nativeEvent, nativeEventTarget) {\n  var shouldSetEventType = isStartish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.startShouldSetResponder : isMoveish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.moveShouldSetResponder : topLevelType === 'topSelectionChange' ? eventTypes.selectionChangeShouldSetResponder : eventTypes.scrollShouldSetResponder;\n\n  // TODO: stop one short of the current responder.\n  var bubbleShouldSetFrom = !responderInst ? targetInst : EventPluginUtils.getLowestCommonAncestor(responderInst, targetInst);\n\n  // When capturing/bubbling the \"shouldSet\" event, we want to skip the target\n  // (deepest ID) if it happens to be the current responder.
