 <h1>Toby Jones Demo Site</h1>
	  

		<p>I created this Ruby on Rails site to learn how to:<ul>
		<li>Install rails, <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-circle"></span></li>
		<li>Build a React JS app to run in Rails, <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-circle"></span></li>
		<li>Apply Bootstrap popups and styles, <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-circle"></span></li>
		<li>Configure AWS,  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-circle"></span></li>
		<li>Connect to a database with Ruby, an <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-circle"></span></li>
		<li>Deploy my code to Amazon with Elastic Beanstalk. <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-circle"></span></li>
		
		</ul> 
		I'm using a Linux Mint command line.

		<p>I've been a full stack software developer/engineer/analyst for over 15 
		years.  I've also done professional work building desktop 
		applications in DotNet C#, C, Java, and various scripting languages. 
		Everything I've learned about Ruby on Rails so far leads me to 
		believe it's worth learning.
